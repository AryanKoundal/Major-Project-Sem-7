# <a name="_toc152813976"></a>**Theoretical Background**
![ref2]

1. ## <a name="_toc152713606"></a><a name="_toc152813977"></a>**Global trends in population ageing**
Population ageing, which entails an increasing share of elderly persons in a population, represents an unprecedented global demographic transformation and is expected to intensify as the twenty-first century progresses. Ageing results from demographic transition, a process whereby reductions in mortality are followed by reductions in fertility. This process then leads to a relative reduction in the proportion of children and an increase in the share of people in the main working age and older person groups in the population.

#### **Current Trends:**
- While global ageing can be seen as a symbol of medical, social, and economic advances, it has led to health, social, and economic consequences over the past half-century. 
- Population ageing represents major policy challenges and therefore threatens to topple existing insurance and pension systems and create health system overload; thus, it calls for a review of existing models of healthcare, familial, and social support. 
- In the 21st century, the phenomenon of global ageing has the potential to fundamentally alter disease burdens, the health care system and its costs, family and social structure, economies and trade, and human migration patterns.

  1. ## <a name="_toc152713607"></a><a name="_toc152813978"></a>**Population ageing in India**
India, with approximately 1.36 billion inhabitants in 2019, is anticipated to become the world's most populous country in the next six years. In 2011, individuals aged 60 and above constituted 8.6% of the population, numbering 103 million. Projections indicate a rise to 19.5% (319 million) by 2050. Considering the pre-retirement phase, those aged 45 and above will surpass 40% of the population, reaching 655 million by 2050. Factors such as declining fertility and increased life expectancy contribute to these trends, signaling potential challenges like heightened old-age dependency and economic implications, yet comprehensive insights into these aspects remain limited.

<a name="_toc152816987"></a><a name="_toc152817954"></a>*Figure 2-1Trends in crude birth and death rate, India, 1950-2050*

India's population distribution trends reveal a decline in the child population to 18.5% by 2050 from 37.5% in 1950. The working-age group (15-59 years) is expected to increase from 58.4% in 2000 to 62% by 2050. The median age will rise from 21.3 in 1950 to 38.1 in 2050, reflecting demographic transition. Additionally, the crude birth rate is projected to decrease from 20.4 in 2011 to 11.8 by 2050, while the crude death rate is expected to increase from 6.3 in 2017 to 7.3 in 2020.

While India is being propelled to a position of international eminence, it faces three main domains of health challenges. 

- First, India needs to deal effectively with the unfinished agenda of communicable diseases, maternal and child health, and the strengthening of health systems. 
- Second, it needs to deal with emerging challenges such as the premature burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). 
- Third, India needs to deal with globalisation-related issues while also contributing to the management and shaping of the global policy environment. 

  However, out of pocket expenditures at the point of health service account for more than 70% of health expenditure, leading to health vulnerability in the older population. India is currently developing policies and establishing health care and social security programmes to support a rapidly ageing population. With India having a decentralised policy system, many of these programmes are to be implemented at the state level.

1. ## <a name="_toc152813979"></a>**Demography of ageing in India**
India experiences unprecedented demographic shifts, with rising longevity and declining fertility creating a 'demographic dividend' but also increasing the elderly population, especially those aged 60 and above. The 'oldest old' (80 years and above) group has doubled in the past 65 years, contributing to a rapidly growing old-age dependency ratio. The feminization of the elderly poses unique challenges due to a widening life expectancy gender gap. The diverse needs of the elderly, from financial security to social participation, require nuanced policy responses for different age cohorts. 

The elderly population is not a homogenous group, especially in a diverse society like India. The concerns of the young-old and oldest-old vary considerably in terms of financial security, functional incompetency, loneliness, and social and work participation. This pronounced diversity calls for a comprehensive understanding of various age cohorts within the elderly population so that appropriate measures and policies are formed well in time.

1. ## <a name="_toc152813980"></a>**Challenges and Impacts of an Ageing Workforce**
By the year 2050, it is projected that the elderly population in India, comprising individuals aged 60 and above, will witness a significant surge, reaching approximately 340 million people.

#### **Challenges Faced by the Elderly in India:**
####
1. **Healthcare:** India lacks the necessary infrastructure and expertise to support the health and welfare of the elderly. Healthcare costs, lack of financial support, and seclusion are some of the major concerns for most Indian senior citizens. Additionally, the prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity among the elderly population further exacerbates their healthcare needs.
1. **Work Participation and Productivity:** The labour force participation among the elderly population in India is significantly influenced by factors such as education, socioeconomic condition, gender, place of residence, and health status. Many elderly individuals continue to work in the informal sector, which is associated with unfavourable health outcomes, high rates of morbidity, and disability.
1. **Social and Economic Vulnerabilities:** The elderly population in India faces various vulnerabilities based on education, socioeconomic status, gender, and place of residence. These vulnerabilities can lead to disparities in access to healthcare, social support, and financial security, further impacting their overall well-being and work participation.
1. **Mental Health:** Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline are prevalent among the elderly population in India. These mental health challenges can negatively impact their work participation, productivity, and overall quality of life.

#### **Impact on Productivity and Work:**
####
1. **Health Status:** Health is the main determinant of working into old age in India. Chronic diseases and poor health conditions can lead to productivity loss among the middle-aged and elderly population. Ensuring healthy aging is crucial for maintaining work participation and productivity among the elderly in India.
1. **Informal Sector Employment:** A significant proportion of the elderly population in India works in the informal sector, which is associated with unfavourable health outcomes and limited social security benefits. This can lead to reduced productivity and increased vulnerability among the elderly workforces.
1. **Social Support and Living Arrangements:** The satisfaction and well-being of the elderly population are influenced by their living arrangements and social support systems [10]. Dissatisfaction with living arrangements can negatively impact their mental and physical health outcomes, further affecting their work participation and productivity.

The growing elderly population in India presents significant challenges related to work participation, productivity, and mental and physical health outcomes. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving healthcare infrastructure, promoting healthy aging, ensuring financial security, and enhancing social support systems for the elderly population. To enhance the well-being and quality of life for the older population in India, policymakers have the opportunity to identify and tackle the factors that influence healthy aging. By doing so, they can actively promote and ensure the overall well-being of older individuals.

`	`The job titles were subjected to clustering based on their associated skills, employing the K-Means algorithm to discern patterns within the dataset. After a careful analysis, the optimal number of clusters was determined to be 8. This strategic clustering not only categorizes jobs but also groups them in a manner that reflects the similarities in the required skill sets.

To elaborate further, the K-Means algorithm segregates job titles into distinct clusters, each characterized by a set of shared skills. The underlying assumption is that jobs within the same cluster exhibit analogous skill requirements. Consequently, when seeking jobs with similar skill profiles, one can effectively consider other jobs within the same cluster as potential matches. This clustering approach facilitates a more nuanced understanding of job relationships, aiding both job seekers and employers in identifying roles that align closely with specific skill prerequisites.

The utilization of the K-Means algorithm in clustering job titles provides a systematic and data-driven method to organize roles based on skill similarities. This approach enhances the efficiency of job searches by enabling individuals and organizations to explore related roles within the same cluster, streamlining the process of identifying suitable job opportunities
