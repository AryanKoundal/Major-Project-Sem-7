The primary objective of this study is to establish a model for forecasting human life expectancy and to delve into the connections between work participation, The effects of productivity, as well as the mental and physical health outcomes, on the elderly population in India. With the increasing number of ageing individuals, it is essential to understand the effects of work on their overall well-being. By leveraging data from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI), this research scrutinizes the links between work status and a range of health outcomes, such as depression, anxiety, physical functioning, and chronic conditions. Additionally, the study investigates the role of productivity in these relationships, considering factors like occupation, income, and social support.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of work participation and its association with mental and physical health outcomes among the elderly in India. Life satisfaction, informal sector employment, work stress, multimorbidity, depression, and chronic diseases all play important roles in determining the health and well-being of the country's older individuals. The purpose of this study is to add to the growing body of research by offering insights into the complicated interplay between work, productivity, and health outcomes among India's older population.

The study's findings have the potential to affect policy decisions in India aimed at encouraging healthy ageing and improving the quality of life for the elderly. Moreover, the results contribute to the global conversation on healthy aging and the role of work and productivity in fostering positive health outcomes for older adults. By understanding the factors that contribute to favourable health outcomes among the elderly population, policymakers can make informed decisions related to retirement age, social security, and healthcare for the elderly in India, ultimately promoting a better quality of life for this growing demographic.

1. ## <a name="_toc152813972"></a>**Motivation**
As the elderly population in India continues to grow, there is a pressing need to investigate the complex relationship between work participation, productivity, and the mental and physical health outcomes of this demographic. Recent research has highlighted the significance of work in shaping the well-being of older individuals in India, with factors like life satisfaction, informal sector employment, work stress, multimorbidity, depression, and chronic diseases playing pivotal roles.

However, there is still a gap in our understanding of how various aspects of work, including occupation, income, and social support, are interconnected with health outcomes among the elderly population in India. Additionally, there is a lack of a comprehensive model for forecasting human life expectancy in this context. These knowledge gaps pose significant challenges for policymakers seeking to promote healthy aging and improve the quality of life for older adults in India.

Therefore, the primary problem that this study aims to address is: How do work participation and productivity influence the mental and physical health outcomes of the elderly population in India, and what is the potential impact on their life expectancy? This research project seeks to bridge these gaps in knowledge, offering insights into the intricate interplay between work, productivity, and health outcomes among India's older adults.

The findings of this study not only hold the potential to inform policy decisions within India, including those related to retirement age, social security, and healthcare for the elderly but also contribute to the global discourse on healthy ageing. By unravelling the connections between work and health in the context of India's ageing population, this research project aims to pave the way for policies and interventions that enhance the overall quality of life for this growing demographic.



1. ## <a name="_toc152813973"></a>**Problem Statement**
   *“The prospect of living a longer life appears to be heightened when individuals opt to delay their retirement.”*

The problem statement posits the potential correlation between an extended lifespan and the postponement of retirement. This inquiry prompts an examination into the complex interplay of variables influencing longevity in individuals who opt for a later retirement age. The investigation entails a nuanced analysis of factors such as lifestyle choices, healthcare accessibility, social engagement, and financial security during the extended post-retirement period. Implications of such a relationship extend to individual and societal levels, impacting retirement policies, workforce dynamics, and healthcare resource allocation. Consequently, a refined understanding of this association becomes imperative for informed policy formulation and strategic planning.

# <a name="_toc152813976"></a>**Theoretical Background**
![ref2]

1. ## <a name="_toc152713606"></a><a name="_toc152813977"></a>**Global trends in population ageing**
Population ageing, which entails an increasing share of elderly persons in a population, represents an unprecedented global demographic transformation and is expected to intensify as the twenty-first century progresses. Ageing results from demographic transition, a process whereby reductions in mortality are followed by reductions in fertility. This process then leads to a relative reduction in the proportion of children and an increase in the share of people in the main working age and older person groups in the population.

#### **Current Trends:**
- While global ageing can be seen as a symbol of medical, social, and economic advances, it has led to health, social, and economic consequences over the past half-century. 
- Population ageing represents major policy challenges and therefore threatens to topple existing insurance and pension systems and create health system overload; thus, it calls for a review of existing models of healthcare, familial, and social support. 
- In the 21st century, the phenomenon of global ageing has the potential to fundamentally alter disease burdens, the health care system and its costs, family and social structure, economies and trade, and human migration patterns.

  1. ## <a name="_toc152713607"></a><a name="_toc152813978"></a>**Population ageing in India**
India, with approximately 1.36 billion inhabitants in 2019, is anticipated to become the world's most populous country in the next six years. In 2011, individuals aged 60 and above constituted 8.6% of the population, numbering 103 million. Projections indicate a rise to 19.5% (319 million) by 2050. Considering the pre-retirement phase, those aged 45 and above will surpass 40% of the population, reaching 655 million by 2050. Factors such as declining fertility and increased life expectancy contribute to these trends, signaling potential challenges like heightened old-age dependency and economic implications, yet comprehensive insights into these aspects remain limited.

![](images\Aspose.Words.98bc25d7-bb44-48d8-93d1-4944aaa6d2b9.007.png)

<a name="_toc152816987"></a><a name="_toc152817954"></a>*Figure 21Trends in crude birth and death rate, India, 1950-2050*

India's population distribution trends reveal a decline in the child population to 18.5% by 2050 from 37.5% in 1950. The working-age group (15-59 years) is expected to increase from 58.4% in 2000 to 62% by 2050. The median age will rise from 21.3 in 1950 to 38.1 in 2050, reflecting demographic transition. Additionally, the crude birth rate is projected to decrease from 20.4 in 2011 to 11.8 by 2050, while the crude death rate is expected to increase from 6.3 in 2017 to 7.3 in 2020.

While India is being propelled to a position of international eminence, it faces three main domains of health challenges. 

- First, India needs to deal effectively with the unfinished agenda of communicable diseases, maternal and child health, and the strengthening of health systems. 
- Second, it needs to deal with emerging challenges such as the premature burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). 
- Third, India needs to deal with globalisation-related issues while also contributing to the management and shaping of the global policy environment. 

  However, out of pocket expenditures at the point of health service account for more than 70% of health expenditure, leading to health vulnerability in the older population. India is currently developing policies and establishing health care and social security programmes to support a rapidly ageing population. With India having a decentralised policy system, many of these programmes are to be implemented at the state level.

1. ## <a name="_toc152813979"></a>**Demography of ageing in India**
India experiences unprecedented demographic shifts, with rising longevity and declining fertility creating a 'demographic dividend' but also increasing the elderly population, especially those aged 60 and above. The 'oldest old' (80 years and above) group has doubled in the past 65 years, contributing to a rapidly growing old-age dependency ratio. The feminization of the elderly poses unique challenges due to a widening life expectancy gender gap. The diverse needs of the elderly, from financial security to social participation, require nuanced policy responses for different age cohorts. 

The elderly population is not a homogenous group, especially in a diverse society like India. The concerns of the young-old and oldest-old vary considerably in terms of financial security, functional incompetency, loneliness, and social and work participation. This pronounced diversity calls for a comprehensive understanding of various age cohorts within the elderly population so that appropriate measures and policies are formed well in time.

1. ## <a name="_toc152813980"></a>**Challenges and Impacts of an Ageing Workforce**
By the year 2050, it is projected that the elderly population in India, comprising individuals aged 60 and above, will witness a significant surge, reaching approximately 340 million people.

#### **Challenges Faced by the Elderly in India:**
####
1. **Healthcare:** India lacks the necessary infrastructure and expertise to support the health and welfare of the elderly. Healthcare costs, lack of financial support, and seclusion are some of the major concerns for most Indian senior citizens. Additionally, the prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity among the elderly population further exacerbates their healthcare needs.
1. **Work Participation and Productivity:** The labour force participation among the elderly population in India is significantly influenced by factors such as education, socioeconomic condition, gender, place of residence, and health status. Many elderly individuals continue to work in the informal sector, which is associated with unfavourable health outcomes, high rates of morbidity, and disability.
1. **Social and Economic Vulnerabilities:** The elderly population in India faces various vulnerabilities based on education, socioeconomic status, gender, and place of residence. These vulnerabilities can lead to disparities in access to healthcare, social support, and financial security, further impacting their overall well-being and work participation.
1. **Mental Health:** Mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline are prevalent among the elderly population in India. These mental health challenges can negatively impact their work participation, productivity, and overall quality of life.

#### **Impact on Productivity and Work:**
####
1. **Health Status:** Health is the main determinant of working into old age in India. Chronic diseases and poor health conditions can lead to productivity loss among the middle-aged and elderly population. Ensuring healthy aging is crucial for maintaining work participation and productivity among the elderly in India.
1. **Informal Sector Employment:** A significant proportion of the elderly population in India works in the informal sector, which is associated with unfavourable health outcomes and limited social security benefits. This can lead to reduced productivity and increased vulnerability among the elderly workforces.
1. **Social Support and Living Arrangements:** The satisfaction and well-being of the elderly population are influenced by their living arrangements and social support systems [10]. Dissatisfaction with living arrangements can negatively impact their mental and physical health outcomes, further affecting their work participation and productivity.

The growing elderly population in India presents significant challenges related to work participation, productivity, and mental and physical health outcomes. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving healthcare infrastructure, promoting healthy aging, ensuring financial security, and enhancing social support systems for the elderly population. To enhance the well-being and quality of life for the older population in India, policymakers have the opportunity to identify and tackle the factors that influence healthy aging. By doing so, they can actively promote and ensure the overall well-being of older individuals.

1. ## <a name="_bookmark7"></a><a name="_toc152813982"></a>**Elderly age group studies conducted in India**
Several studies conducted in India have explored the relationship between health issues, socioeconomic factors, and workforce participation among the elderly population.

1. A study using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) found that alterations in social interactions can induce stress and precipitate cognitive decline in old age, affecting workforce participation.
1. Another study using LASI data found that health is the main determinant of working into old age, making healthy aging a priority for the future of the country.
1. A study using data from the 75th round of the NSSO survey found that the prevalence of self- reported chronic disease was 21 per 100 elderly Indian persons, with hypertension and diabetes being the most common diseases. These chronic illnesses can impair elderly people's capacity to work.
1. A cross-sectional study conducted in rural Bengaluru discovered the prevalence of frailty among elderly individuals was associated with factors such as age, gender, education, occupation, and the presence of chronic diseases. These factors can influence the workforce participation of older adults in India.
1. A study using data from the Building a Knowledge Base on Population Aging in India (BKPAI) survey found that socioeconomic status, social capital, and functional independence were associated with subjective well-being among older Indian adults. These factors can impact the ability of older adults to participate in the workforce.
1. A cross-sectional study conducted in rural Thanjavur district of South India found that the prevalence of physical frailty among community-dwelling older adults was 30.65%.

Navigating the Challenges of an Aging Workforce in India is a complex issue that requires a multidimensional approach which can be seen as evident when looking at the following key findings:

- The growing senior population poses various issues, including increasing demand for healthcare services, an increased risk of chronic illnesses, and lower labour-force participation (Debnath et al., 2023; Gustafsson et al., 2022). It also emphasises the need of policies and Initiatives aimed at improving the well-being and enhancing the quality of life for the senior population of India (Debnath et al., 2023).
- One of the challenges of managing an aging workforce in India is the gender inequality and limited career advancement opportunities for women (Datta & Agarwal, 2017). Research has shown that Females make up a notable portion of the healthcare industry's workforce on a global scale, However, they are frequently concentrated in less prominent positions within the healthcare sector (Karan et al., 2021). This gender inequality in the workforce is a serious concern and needs to be addressed to ensure equal opportunities for women in the workplace (Datta & Agarwal, 2017).
- Another issue is The impact of continued employment during advanced ages on health results. A big proportion of India's elderly population works after retirement age, and the sort of employment they do can have serious consequences for their health. (Chowdhury et al., 2023; Chowdhury et al., 2022). Studies have shown that the type of work, whether formal or informal sector employment, plays a significant role in determining health outcomes among older workers (Chowdhury et al., 2023; Chowdhury et al., 2022). Factors such as socio-economic status, demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviours, and work characteristics also influence health outcomes (Chowdhury et al., 2023).
- India's ageing workforce also creates economic issues, Factors such as rising expenditure on pensions and healthcare, the necessity for modifications in social security systems, and a shrinking workforce. (Singh et al., 2013; Venkatesan & Venkataraman, 2019). The ageing population need forward-thinking policies that encourage investing for a better living after retirement (Venkatesan & Venkataraman, 2019). Furthermore, the banking industry in India is experiencing labour issues as a result of shifting demographics and technology advancements (Roy & Vishwanathan, 2018). These issues include regulatory concerns, technological advancements, severe competition, and operational risk. (Roy & Vishwanathan, 2018).
- Furthermore, the leadership skills gap in the healthcare system is a concern for achieving ambitious health reforms in India (Gulati et al., 2022). The absence of structured and forward- looking leadership training for the healthcare workforce impedes the advancement of health reforms. (Gulati et al., 2022). Strengthening leadership capacity is crucial for effective management and implementation of healthcare policies and initiatives.
- To address the challenges of an aging workforce in India, it is important to develop evidence- based public health curricula and invest in the health workforce (Joshi et al., 2022). Understanding the needs, skills, and expertise required in the public health and allied fields is essential for effective workforce planning and development (Joshi et al., 2022). Additionally, managing diversity in the workforce is crucial for organizational efficiency and performance (Inegbedion et al., 2020). Strategically managing workforce diversity enhances organizational performance and contributes to inclusive growth (Inegbedion et al., 2020).

1. #### **Logistic Regression Model**
- Implement a logistic regression model on the pre-processed data.
- Set up a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.
- Check the model's performance on both the training and test sets.

**Setting Up a Confusion Matrix**

Define and calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using the confusion matrix.

A confusion matrix is a table used in classification to assess the performance of a machine learning model. It provides a comprehensive view of the predictions made by a model by comparing them to the actual labels. The four main components of a confusion matrix are True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN). These components are used to calculate various metrics that evaluate the model's performance.

**Here's a breakdown of the components of a confusion matrix:**

- True Positives (TP):
- Instances that are actually positive and are correctly predicted as positive by the model.
- True Negatives (TN):
  - Instances that are actually negative and are correctly predicted as negative by the model.
- False Positives (FP):
  - Instances that are actually negative but are incorrectly predicted as positive by the model. Also known as Type I errors.
- False Negatives (FN):
  - Instances that are actually positive but are incorrectly predicted as negative by the model. Also known as Type II errors.

We can calculate accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of model to test performance of our model.

**Check Model Performance on Training and Test Set**

- Evaluate the logistic regression model on the training set to ensure it is learning from the data.
- Assess its performance on the test set to gauge generalization.
- For this ROC-AUC curve can be used-

ROC-AUC, or Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve, is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class is more prevalent than the other.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve:

- The ROC curve is a graphical representation of a binary classification model's performance across different threshold settings. It plots the True Positive Rate (Sensitivity or Recall) against the False Positive Rate for various threshold values.
- The curve helps to visualize how well the model distinguishes between positive and negative instances across different decision boundaries.

Area Under the Curve (AUC):

- AUC represents the area under the ROC curve. It quantifies the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative instances.
- AUC ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher AUC indicates better model performance. A model with an AUC of 0.5 is essentially making random predictions, while an AUC of 1.0 represents perfect discrimination.

**Defining the Matrix**

Interpret the confusion matrix results and discuss the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives.

**Finding the Balanced Threshold Using the Precision-Recall Curve**

- Explore different threshold values for balancing precision and recall using the precision-recall curve.
- Choose an optimal threshold that aligns with project goals.
1. #### **Tuned Logistic Regression**
Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in the model development process to ensure that the chosen algorithm is configured optimally for a specific task, leading to improved performance, generalization, and robustness. It's an integral part of achieving the best possible model for a given problem.

Here to do the tuning we follow the given steps using GRID SEARCH METHOD

steps

**Define the Model:** Choose the machine learning algorithm you want to tune, and define its architecture or structure.

**Define the Hyperparameter Grid:** Specify the hyperparameters you want to tune and their possible values. This creates a grid of hyperparameter combinations to be tested.

**Set up Cross-Validation:** Choose a cross-validation strategy (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to evaluate model performance on different subsets of the training data.

**Perform Grid Search:** Train the model using each combination of hyperparameter values defined in the grid. Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and a specified evaluation metric.

**Select the Best Model:** Identify the combination of hyperparameter values that result in the best performance according to the chosen evaluation metric.

**Train the Final Model:** Train the model using the entire training dataset and the selected optimal hyperparameter values.

**Evaluate on Test Set:** Assess the final model's performance on a separate test set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.

Fine-tune hyperparameters of the logistic regression model using grid search or other optimization techniques.

Re-evaluate model performance after hyperparameter tuning.
1. #### **Decision Tree Model**
- Implement a decision tree model on the pre-processed data.
- Assess the model's performance on training and test sets.
#### **An Overfitted Model! Let's Try to Fix This**
- Identify signs of overfitting in the decision tree model.
- Discuss strategies for addressing overfitting.
1. #### **Tuned Decision Tree Model**

- Evaluate the model's performance after hyperparameter tuning.
#### **Reducing the Overfitting Problem**
- Discuss how the tuned decision tree model addresses overfitting.
- Compare the performance before and after tuning.
1. #### **Testing and Conclusion**
- Compare the performance of the logistic regression and decision tree models.
- Draw conclusions about the effectiveness of each model.
- Discuss the implications of the findings for predicting mental health based on the dataset.

**Comparing the Models**

- Provide a comprehensive comparison of the logistic regression and decision tree models.
- Consider metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

A comprehensive study leveraging data from Open Sourcing Mental Health (OSMI), a non-profit organization committed to fostering mental wellness within the tech and open source communities, has been conducted. OSMI is dedicated to raising awareness, delivering education, and offering resources to support mental well-being in these sectors.

The study focused on the OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey 2014, which garnered responses from over 1200 participants. The primary objective of this survey was to assess attitudes toward mental health within the tech workplace. Additionally, it sought to explore the prevalence of mental health disorders among individuals working in the tech industry. This valuable dataset provides insights into the nuanced landscape of mental wellness within the tech and open source communities, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities for fostering a supportive and healthy work environment.

The logistic regression tuned model is most ideal: Has the highest accuracy, recall, and F1 among the four models generated.

1. ### <a name="_toc152814005"></a>**Conclusion** 

Several predictor variables have significant coefficients, indicating that they have a statistically significant effect on the outcome variable. For instance, family history, work interference, and care options are positively related to the likelihood of receiving treatment. Work interference variables are the highest positive values among the variables. This indicates that when mental health interferes with work, they are more likely to seek medical help. Having a family history of a mental health condition, awareness of the presence of benefits, and care options, and anonymity in the workplace make it more likely that the employee will seek medical help.

Interestingly, reaching out to coworkers may more likely prompt an employee to seek medical help; while reaching out to supervisors decreases the chance to seek medical help. Gender variables are negative, meaning males and queers are more likely to avoid getting medical help than females.


**We used four models in total**

- Logistic regression model
- Tuned Logistic regression model
- Decision Tree Model
- Tuned Decision Tree Model

The logistic regression tuned model is ideal: Has the highest accuracy, recall, and F1 among the four models generated. Ideally, we should reiterate that, for this subject we want as many employees to be identified as needing treatment so we want a high recall.

![ref2]

*In this chapter, the outcomes of our model are explained*


1. ## <a name="_toc152814007"></a>**Results**
**Work Participation Task:**

The application of the K-Means algorithm in clustering job titles yielded valuable insights into skill-based patterns within the dataset. With eight determined clusters, the approach effectively categorized jobs and identified shared skill sets. This systematic organization enhances job searches, allowing users and organizations to explore related roles within the same cluster. The K-Means algorithm proves to be a robust and data-driven method, streamlining the identification of suitable job opportunities by considering skill similarities.

**Productivity Task:**

In the productivity task, the system optimized job recommendations based on the user's current job and age. By associating the user's job with a specific cluster, jobs with similar skill profiles were retrieved and sorted based on relative productivity at the given age. The approach aims to assist users in exploring more suitable and productive career opportunities aligned with their skills and age-related productivity trends. This tailored recommendation system offers a strategic and user-centric approach to career planning.

**Mental Health Task:**

The analysis of predictor variables in the mental health task revealed significant coefficients influencing the likelihood of seeking treatment. Variables such as family history, work interference, and care options demonstrated a positive relationship with seeking medical help. Notably, gender variables indicated that males and non-binary individuals were more likely to avoid seeking medical help than females. Four models were employed, with the logistic regression tuned model emerging as the most ideal, boasting the highest accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. This emphasizes the importance of tailored interventions, considering the diverse factors impacting employees' decisions to seek mental health treatment.

These results collectively underscore the effectiveness of data-driven approaches in workforce management. The systematic clustering of job titles enhances job searches, while personalized recommendations based on productivity trends and mental health considerations contribute to a more user-centric and supportive work environment. The findings offer valuable insights for both individuals and organizations seeking to optimize workforce engagement, career satisfaction, and overall well-being.
1. ## <a name="_toc152713643"></a><a name="_toc152814008"></a>**Comparison with state-of-the-art**
This effort adds to the limited research on the topic in India and is consistent with other studies that show a good relationship between employment engagement, productivity, and health outcomes among the senior population. The study points out the socio-economic and demographic determinants of elderly labour force participation in India. There are important insights into the patterns and determinants of elderly workforce participation in India and it sheds light on the prevalence of informal sector employment, low-skilled occupations, and the influence of socio-economic factors on labour force participation among the elderly, and in comparison to state-of-the-art studies, these Indian studies also contribute to the understanding of elderly workforce participation in a specific context, taking into account the unique socio-economic and demographic factors of India. They provide valuable evidence on the changes in labor force participation among the elderly over time and highlight the need for further research in this area.




***Chapter 6***
# <a name="_toc152814009"></a>**Conclusion and Future work**
![ref2]

*In this chapter, the future perspectives of this model are explained*

In conclusion, the integration of data-driven approaches, such as clustering job titles and optimizing job recommendations, has proven to be instrumental in enhancing workforce management. The K-Means algorithm's application in the work participation task streamlined job searches by categorizing roles based on shared skill sets, providing a nuanced understanding of job relationships for both job seekers and employers. The productivity task optimized job recommendations, aligning roles with users' skills and age-related productivity trends, fostering more suitable and productive career opportunities. The mental health task's analysis of predictor variables shed light on significant factors influencing employees' decisions to seek treatment, emphasizing the importance of tailored interventions and support systems.

For future work, the system can be further refined by incorporating real-time data and continuous learning mechanisms. This would enable the model to adapt to evolving skill requirements, productivity trends, and mental health dynamics in the workforce. Additionally, exploring advanced clustering algorithms and machine learning techniques could enhance the accuracy of job recommendations and mental health predictions. Collaboration with healthcare professionals and organizations could provide valuable insights into refining mental health interventions and support systems tailored to individual needs. Overall, continuous iteration and adaptation based on emerging trends and technologies will ensure the sustained effectiveness of the system in optimizing workforce engagement and well-being.
